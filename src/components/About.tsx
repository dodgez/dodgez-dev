        As a Software Engineer at Stripe with a Masters in Mathematics, I have
        9+ years of experience in programming and engineering. I have designed
        and implemented crucial features for a website with tens of thousands of
        daily active users, including creation of a feature flag service,
        implementing smarter website routing logic, decreasing unit test time
        and development server startup time by 60% and 50% and continuous
        integration and deployment for micro-frontend packages.
